# 🦁 Benji Peng's Hugo-Powered Links Page

Welcome to the digital den of Dr. Benji Peng, where biophysics meets the web! 🧬💻

## 🚀 What's This All About?

This project is a sleek, minimalist links page powered by the awesome [Lynx theme](https://github.com/jpanther/lynx) for Hugo. It's where I, Dr. Benji Peng (aka Dr. Honeycutt 🍯), showcase my professional and social media presence in one stylish spot.

## ✨ Features

- 🌓 Dark mode support (because science happens day and night)
- 📱 Fully responsive design (looks great on everything from smartphones to electron microscopes)
- 🎨 Customized link styles (each link is as unique as a protein fold)
- 🚀 Fast loading times (quicker than a quantum leap)
- 🔍 SEO-friendly (so you can find me easier than a needle in a haystack)
